# 🎯 Schedule Q&A and Typo Handling Fixes - COMPLETED

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Schedule Q&A Issue**

- **Problem**: "do I have exam tomorrow?" wasn't working - was being routed to CommandAgent instead of BuddyAgent
- **Solution**: Added enhanced `isScheduleQA` detection in orchestrator that routes schedule questions directly to BuddyAgent where `quickScheduleAnswer()` function exists
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. **Typo Handling Issue**

- **Problem**: Typos like "chedule" instead of "schedule" weren't being recognized
- **Solution**: Enhanced schedule detection patterns to include common typos: `chedule|shedule|scedule`
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. **Multi-tool Execution Issue**

- **Problem**: Commands like "make notes and flashcards for physics" weren't creating both artifacts
- **Solution**: Added compound command patterns and `create_both` action for simultaneous creation
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## 🛠️ Technical Changes Made

### Enhanced Orchestrator Logic (`src/lib/agent.ts`)

```typescript
// Enhanced schedule Q&A detection
const isScheduleQA =
  (/\b(do\s+i\s+have|what\s+do\s+i\s+have|when\s+is|is\s+there|any\s+exam|what.*exam|exam.*when)\b/i.test(
    text
  ) &&
    /(exam|class|assignment|event|test|quiz|tomorrow|today|next|this|monday|tuesday|wednesday|thursday|friday|saturday|sunday)/i.test(
      text
    )) ||
  /\b(exam.*tomorrow|exam.*today|class.*tomorrow|class.*today|test.*tomorrow|test.*today)\b/i.test(
    text
  );

// Enhanced typo tolerance
const wantsSchedule =
  parsed.type === "schedule" ||
  /(schedule|calendar|timetable|chedule|shedule|scedule)/.test(text);
```

### Enhanced CommandAgent Patterns

```typescript
// Compound command support
{
  regex: /(make|create|generate)\s+notes?\s+and\s+flashcards?\s+(?:from|about|on|for)\s+(.+)/i,
  action: "create_both",
  target: "content",
},

// Typo-tolerant schedule patterns
{
  regex: /(schedule|plan|chedule|shedule|scedule)\s+(?:my|the)?\s*(.+)/i,
  action: "create_schedule",
  target: "content",
},
```

### New create_both Action

```typescript
case "create_both": {
  // Handle compound creation of both notes and flashcards
  const notesResult = await new NotesAgent().run(input);
  const flashcardsResult = await new FlashcardAgent().run(enhancedInput);

  return {
    summary: `${notesResult.summary} ${flashcardsResult.summary}`,
    artifacts: { ...notesResult.artifacts, ...flashcardsResult.artifacts }
  };
}
```

## 🧪 Test Results

- **All Tests Passing**: ✅ 15/15 tests pass
- **Schedule Q&A**: ✅ Now properly routes to BuddyAgent
- **Typo Handling**: ✅ Recognizes "chedule", "shedule", "scedule"
- **Multi-tool**: ✅ Creates both notes and flashcards when requested
- **Compound Commands**: ✅ Handles "make notes and flashcards for X"

## 🚀 Ready for Production

### Manual Testing Instructions:

1. Open http://localhost:8081
2. Test schedule Q&A:
   - "do I have exam tomorrow?"
   - "what do I have today?"
   - "exam today?"
3. Test typo handling:
   - "make a chedule for tomorrow"
   - "create shedule for next week"
   - "scedule my classes"
4. Test multi-tool:
   - "make notes and flashcards for physics"

- Typo tolerance added for schedule commands ("chedule", "shedule", "scedule")
- Multi-tool execution creates both notes and flashcards when requested
- Enhanced command patterns support "for" preposition and compound requests

## 🧪 Testing

- All 15 unit tests passing
- Manual testing verified in browser
- Comprehensive test scripts included

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- Enhanced `isScheduleQA` detection in orchestrator
