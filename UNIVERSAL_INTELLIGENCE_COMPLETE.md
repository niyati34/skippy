- **Creative Tasks**: Content generation, explanation, simplification
- **Problem Solving**: Mathematical reasoning, algorithm explanation
- **Planning & Organization**: Study schedules, goal setting, optimization
- **Communication**: Writing assistance, presentation prep

#### 3. **Intelligent Memory System**

- Stores conversation history with topics and timestamps
- Provides contextual understanding across sessions
- Learns your preferences and study patterns
- Offers personalized recommendations

#### 4. **Advanced Execution Engine**

- Routes simple tasks directly for fast responses
- Orchestrates complex multi-step workflows
- Provides comprehensive results with task breakdowns
- Tracks progress and completion status

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### **Before Enhancement:**

```
User: "Help me with my studies"
AI: "I can create flashcards, notes, or schedules. What would you like?"
```

### **After Enhancement:**

```
User: "Help me with my studies"
AI: "I'd love to help! Let me analyze your current progress...

Based on your 15 JavaScript notes and 8 React flashcards, I can see you're
working on web development. Here's what I recommend:

1. 🎯 Create advanced React hooks flashcards (you're ready for this)
2. 📝 Generate practice coding problems for your weak areas
3. 📅 Set up a study schedule for your upcoming project deadline
4. 🔗 Connect your existing notes to create a comprehensive study path

Which would you like to start with? I can also do all of these simultaneously!"
```
