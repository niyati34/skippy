This folder hosts public preview assets for the README and the deployed site.

Suggested files:
- demo.mp4                 # Short screen recording of Skippy in action (<=15â€“30s)

How to update the README preview:
- Put your files here, then update README.md paths if you change names.
- Paths used in README are relative to repo root, e.g. public/preview/screenshot-1.png

These assets are served at /preview/* in production (Vercel), e.g. https://<your-app>.vercel.app/preview/demo.mp4
