# 🚨 URGENT: Security Steps Required

## ⚠️ Your API Keys Were Exposed

Your API keys were accidentally committed to GitHub in `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`. While I've removed them from the latest commit, **they may still be visible in the commit history**.

## ✅ Immediate Actions Required (Do These NOW!)

### 1. Regenerate Gemini API Key 🔑

1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Find your current key: `AIzaSyCtY5-R3jh3qB874AHlNKFnFe6a8tAP-iM`
3. **Delete/Revoke it** immediately
4. Click **"Create API Key"** to generate a new one
5. Copy the new key

### 2. Regenerate OpenRouter API Key 🔑

1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai/keys
2. Find your current key: `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`
3. **Delete/Revoke it** immediately
4. Click **"Create New Key"**
5. Copy the new key

### 3. Update Your Local Environment 📝

Edit `.env.local` and replace with your NEW keys:

```bash
# Replace with NEW Gemini key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-new-gemini-key-here
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-new-gemini-key-here

# Replace with NEW OpenRouter key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-new-openrouter-key-here
```

### 4. Update Vercel Environment Variables 🌐

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `skippy` project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Find and UPDATE these variables with your NEW keys:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` → new Gemini key
   - `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` → new Gemini key
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` → new OpenRouter key
5. Click **Save**
6. Go to **Deployments** → Latest → **Redeploy**

## 🔍 Why This Happened

The documentation file (`VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`) was created with real API keys as examples, which should have been placeholders instead.

## ✅ What I've Done

1. ✅ Replaced real API keys with placeholders in `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. ✅ Amended the commit to remove exposed keys
3. ✅ Force-pushed to overwrite the bad commit
4. ✅ `.env.local` and `.env.vercel` were NEVER committed (protected by .gitignore)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **GitHub keeps commit history**: Even though we overwrote the commit, someone may have already cloned/forked the repository with the old commit
- **Always use placeholders** in documentation files
- **Never commit** real API keys, passwords, or secrets
- **Always check** `git status` before committing

## 🛡️ Best Practices Going Forward

1. ✅ Keep API keys ONLY in `.env.local` (which is in `.gitignore`)
2. ✅ Use placeholders in all documentation (`your-api-key-here`)
3. ✅ Double-check files before `git add`
4. ✅ Review `git diff` before committing
5. ✅ Use `git secrets` or similar tools to prevent accidental commits

## 📞 Need Help?

If you're unsure about any step, STOP and ask before proceeding. It's better to be safe!

**Priority:** DO THIS IMMEDIATELY! 🚨

The exposed keys could be used by anyone who saw the commit before we removed it.
