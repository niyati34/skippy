# 🚀 Simple Git Workflow for Solo Projects

## ❌ DON'T Do This (Too Complicated!)

```bash
# Creating branches for every small change
git checkout -b fix/tiny-typo
# ... make change ...
git commit -m "fix typo"
git push origin fix/tiny-typo
# Then creating Pull Request... way too much work!
```

## ✅ DO This Instead (Simple & Fast!)

### For Small Changes / Daily Work

**Just work on `main` branch:**

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on main
git checkout main

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 3. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 4. Commit and push directly
git add .
git commit -m "fix: update Gemini API and increase token limits"
git push origin main

# Done! That's it! 🎉
```

### When to Use Branches

**Only for BIG features or experiments:**

```bash
# 1. Create branch for major feature
git checkout -b feat/new-major-feature

# 2. Work on it (can take days/weeks)
# ... make multiple commits ...

# 3. When done, merge directly to main (no PR!)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feat/new-major-feature --no-edit
git push origin main

# 4. Delete the branch
git branch -d feat/new-major-feature
git push origin --delete feat/new-major-feature
```

## 🎯 Quick Commands for You

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Start work
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Save work
git add .
git commit -m "your message here"
git push origin main
```

### Check Current Status
```bash
git status           # See what changed
git branch           # See all branches
git log --oneline -5 # See recent commits
```

### Clean Up Old Branches
```bash
# See all local branches
git branch

# Delete local branch
git branch -d branch-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Commit often** - Don't wait for "perfect" code
2. **Push daily** - Backup your work to GitHub
3. **Use clear commit messages** - Future you will thank present you
4. **No PRs needed** - You're the only reviewer!
5. **Keep it simple** - More complexity = more confusion

## 📝 Good Commit Message Format

```bash
# Format: type: brief description

git commit -m "fix: resolve API authentication issue"
git commit -m "feat: add voice recognition feature"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new setup steps"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify login logic"
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
```

## 🗑️ Cleaning Up (What I Just Did)

```bash
# 1. Switched to main and updated it
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Merged your work directly (no PR)
git merge fix/compound-parsing-orchestrator

# 3. Pushed to GitHub
git push origin main

# 4. Deleted old branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v "main" | xargs git branch -d

# Result: Clean repo with just main branch! 🎉
```

## ⚠️ When to Use Pull Requests

Only use PRs when:
- Working with a team
- Need code review from others
- Contributing to open source projects
- Company requires it

**For your personal project? Skip PRs! Work directly on main!**

## 🎓 Summary

**Old way (complicated):**
main → create branch → commit → push → create PR → merge → delete branch

**New way (simple):**
main → commit → push → done!

Save your energy for coding, not Git management! 🚀
