## ðŸ§  Core Architecture

### 1. AdvancedTaskAnalyzer (`src/lib/advancedTaskAnalyzer.ts`)

**Purpose**: AI-powered request analysis with unlimited operation types

- **32+ Operation Types**: create, analyze, summarize, research, investigate, explain, connect, recommend, optimize, enhance, reflect, assess, practice, generate, build, develop, design, construct, improve, synthesize, critique, evaluate, compare, contrast, etc.
- **25+ Target Types**: notes, flashcards, schedule, content, concepts, knowledge-base, mind-maps, study-plans, learning-paths, practice-sessions, assessments, etc.
- **Multi-Stage Analysis**:
  - Intent classification with confidence scoring
  - Deep decomposition into atomic actions
  - Educational psychology alignment
  - Dependency resolution and optimization

### 2. AdvancedTaskExecutor (`src/lib/advancedTaskExecutor.ts`)

**Purpose**: Unlimited task execution with intelligent adaptation

- **AI-Enhanced Operations**: Automatically detects when to use AI for complex operations
- **Dynamic Action Mapping**: Maps unknown operations to existing ones
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Ensures every request gets processed even if AI fails
- **Context-Aware Execution**: Uses previous results to inform subsequent actions
- **Educational Integration**: Stores content appropriately in notes/flashcards/schedule

### 3. AdvancedTaskController (`src/lib/advancedTaskController.ts`)

**Purpose**: Orchestrates analysis and execution with learning insights

- **Seamless Integration**: Connects analyzer with executor
- **Performance Tracking**: Measures success rates and execution time
- **Insight Generation**: Provides learning recommendations
- **Feedback Integration**: Learns from user feedback to improve results

### 4. Enhanced TaskUnderstanding (`src/lib/taskUnderstanding.ts`)

**Purpose**: Intelligent routing between standard and advanced processing

- **Complexity Detection**: Automatically identifies when to use advanced processing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing system
- **Seamless Fallback**: Falls back to standard processing when needed

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
