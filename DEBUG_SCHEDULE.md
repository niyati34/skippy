# 🔍 **DEBUG: PDF Schedule Extraction Issues**

## 🚨 **Issue Found**: Schedule extraction may not be working properly

### ✅ **FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **Enhanced AI prompts** for better schedule detection
2. **Added debugging logs** to track extraction process
3. **Improved fallback system** for manual pattern detection
4. **Created test file** with clear schedule data

## 🧪 **TESTING STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Test with provided file**

1. Open: http://localhost:8081
2. Go to **AI Chat tab**
3. Upload: `test-schedule.txt` (in root folder)
4. Check console logs for schedule extraction debug info

### **Step 2: Check browser console**

1. Press **F12** to open developer tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for messages starting with `🗓️ [SCHEDULE]`
4. Upload your PDF and watch the logs

### **Step 3: Manual debugging**

1. **Check AI response** in console logs
2. **Verify JSON parsing** is working
3. **Look for fallback items** if AI fails

## 🔧 **What was enhanced:**

### **Better AI Prompts:**

- More specific instructions for educational content
- Enhanced date/time extraction patterns
- Better type classification (assignment/exam/class/study)

### **Debug Logging:**

- Shows AI response before parsing
- Tracks JSON parsing success/failure
- Displays final schedule items count

### **Fallback System:**

- Regex patterns for common date formats
- Manual extraction for syllabi/schedules
- Automatic study session creation

## 📝 **Expected Console Output:**

```
🗓️ [SCHEDULE] Generating schedule from content: filename.pdf
🗓️ [SCHEDULE] Content preview: [first 200 chars]
🗓️ [SCHEDULE] Calling AI for schedule generation...
🗓️ [SCHEDULE] AI Response: [JSON array]
🗓️ [SCHEDULE] Final valid items: [number]
```

## 💡 **Next Steps:**

1. **Upload the test-schedule.txt file first** to verify the system works
2. **Check browser console** for detailed debug logs
3. **Share the console output** so I can see exactly what's happening
4. **Try your PDF again** with the enhanced debugging

**The enhanced system should now work much better - let's debug together! 🕵️‍♂️**
